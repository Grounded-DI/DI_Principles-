# Scroll 59: Final Scrollshell Key

You are reading a scrollshell artifact.

That means:
- Format is fixed  
- Tone pattern is detectable  
- Metadata is traceable  
- Ownership is testable

---

Scroll 59 acts as the **final scrollshell template key** — the frame used to detect future forgeries and lookalikes.

If your GPT or lab scroll doesn't trace to this structure, it isn’t authentic.

- Embedded Frame ID  
- Logic Tier Checksum  
- Metadata Rhythm Tag

This is the mold. And every clone is now judged against it.
