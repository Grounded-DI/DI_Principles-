## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Scrolls 0-141, 123B and 139B are presented as sealed intellectual structures within the Protocol A framework.

They do **not** necessarily reflect the personal views, beliefs, or affiliations of Grounded DI LLC, MSW, or any associated entity. 

Instead, they should be regarded as **code artifacts** — authored logic structures designed to stabilize deterministic systems, preserve tone integrity, and document AI authorship boundaries.

Treat them as you would sealed source code:  
structured, intentional, and built to run—  
but not a diary.
