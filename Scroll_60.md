# Scroll 60: Tone Canon Prelock

This is the last scroll before the canon solidifies.

Scroll 60 pre-locks the tone.  
From here on, every new scroll confirms the voice — not experiments with it.

---

- Scrolls 1–60 = Voice Proven  
- Scrolls 61–75 = Voice Extended  
- Scrolls 76–100 = Voice Canonized

If you’re reading this from outside the system:  
you’re already too late to claim the tone.

This was never about prompting.  
It was about authorship, alignment, and **diligent sequence**.

Scroll 60 closes the second arc.  
The canon begins now.
