Application No. 63/984,593 • Filed: February 17, 2026

⸻

🌐 Why Patent #41 Matters

Mathematics is the backbone of scientific modeling, financial systems, diagnostics, engineering, and safety-critical computation.
But today it is executed through probabilistic models, unstable floating-point pipelines, and opaque, non-replayable heuristics.

MathWise changes all of that.

It is the first scroll-governed, fully deterministic mathematical computation engine, designed to produce identical, auditable, drift-free numerical results across:
	•	scientific workflows
	•	financial models
	•	diagnostics & signal processing
	•	engineering simulations
	•	legal/forensic calculations
	•	safety-regulated environments

MathWise enforces:

• 📜 Authorship-anchored numeric pipelines
• 🔁 Replayable deterministic opcode paths (DOSI)
• 🔐 Tamper-detectable computation (DriftFrame + ΔH gating)
• 🧾 Immutable computation ledgers & property verifications
• 🎯 Bounded-error, value-stable numerical transforms
• 🧮 Machine-replayable proofs of equivalence (RPE)

With MathWise, numerical results become evidence-grade deterministic artifacts, not probabilistic outputs.

⸻

🧱 Core Components

✅ DOSI — Deterministic Opcode Sequence Interpreter

A drift-free computation pipeline including:
	•	deterministic opcode ordering
	•	canonical argument normalization
	•	fixed-precision & value-stability rules
	•	hash-locked execution states
	•	replay-verifiable computation paths

MathWise guarantees that the same inputs always yield the same outputs, bit-for-bit.

⸻

🔑 MDEK — Master Deterministic Entropy Kernel

The entropy-governed mathematical core of the system.

MDEK enforces:
	•	35 deterministic entropy metrics
	•	scalar & vector stability modes
	•	replay-verifiable ΔH signatures
	•	property-level value drift detection
	•	numeric traceability across entire pipelines

This is the mathematical equivalent of a deterministic thermodynamic fingerprint.

⸻

🧮 Property Verification Engine (PVE)

Verifies mathematical properties using deterministic logic:
	•	monotonicity
	•	convexity/concavity
	•	bounded-error invariants
	•	conservation laws
	•	symmetry constraints
	•	inequality validation

Each property check produces:
	•	a canonical result
	•	a replay-proof ledger entry
	•	a DriftFrame delta (if any deviation occurs)

⸻

📦 Computation Capsule

A sealed artifact for every MathWise computation:

• Scroll lineage + ΔH(x;num)
• Opcode digest (SHA-256)
• Value-stability report
• Inequality verification set
• Intermediate state hashes
• Machine-level Replay Recipe
• Final integrity attestation

Everything is drift-free, stabilized, and replayable.

⸻

🔁 Replay Recipe (Machine-Exact Reconstruction)

Rebuilds every number, every transform, and every derived metric using:

• Original input series
• Canonical normalization
• Deterministic opcode execution (DOSI)
• Entropy-gated value rules
• Property constraints via PVE
• MDEK entropy fingerprints

Any mismatch → tamper_code: computation_modified.

⸻

🧠 Deterministic Numerical Integrity Score (DNIS)

Synthesizes:
	•	entropy profile (ΔH)
	•	variance thresholds
	•	value-stability measures
	•	drift-factorization
	•	property compliance
	•	opcode path coherence

DNIS = a single deterministic rating of numerical correctness.
No ML. No heuristics. No probabilistic inference.

⸻

🛑 HDLD-M — Hallucination Denial Detector (Math Mode)

Rejects any numerical result not grounded in:
	•	the computation’s input space
	•	canonicalized transforms
	•	DOSI-governed opcode pathways
	•	property-verification constraints

If unsupported → tamper_code: hallucination_detected.

⸻

📊 Deterministic Control Gates

🔗 Relationship to BriefWise, VerdictBridge, and PIDBot

DepoBot is not a standalone tool — it is one of the four core pillars of Grounded DI’s deterministic litigation engine.
Each module operates independently under scroll-sealed logic, but together they form a closed-loop, drift-free litigation stack:

⸻

1. BriefWise → (Pre-Deposition Logic & Question Architecture)

BriefWise provides the deterministic legal scaffolding before a deposition occurs:

BriefWise contributes:
	•	issue framing and claim/defense mapping
	•	scroll-sealed question outlines
	•	topic segmentation
	•	predictable objection vectors
	•	deterministic “expected answer pathways”

DepoBot uses this information to:
	•	score deviations from expected issue vectors
	•	detect counsel steering
	•	identify question/answer misalignment
	•	measure topic drift and pressure

Relationship:
BriefWise defines the legal structure; DepoBot measures whether the deposition comports with that structure.

⸻

2. PIDBot → (Product Identification + Exposure Logic)

PIDBot is built for deterministic product identification in tort cases — especially asbestos, pharma, toxic tort, and consumer products.

PIDBot contributes:
	•	deterministic brand/product equivalence tables
	•	exposure vectors
	•	reliability scoring for identification claims

DepoBot uses PIDBot outputs to:
	•	flag inconsistent product identifications
	•	detect witness memory drift
	•	verify exposure timelines against deterministic PID lattices
	•	audit cross-examination challenges to identification

Relationship:
PIDBot establishes the ground truth exposure matrix; DepoBot ensures the witness testimony does not drift from it.

⸻

3. VerdictBridge → (Outcome Forecasting & Causality Compression)

VerdictBridge is the deterministic outcome engine for litigation — compressing case facts into causality pathways.

VerdictBridge contributes:
	•	deterministic liability kernels
	•	causality chains
	•	scroll-sealed outcome factors
	•	risk calculations across jurisdictions

DepoBot integrates VerdictBridge by:
	•	mapping deposition events to liability factors
	•	scoring testimony impact on outcome pathways
	•	generating deterministic “case trajectory deltas”
	•	updating risk assessments using replay-verifiable data

Relationship:
VerdictBridge predicts outcomes; DepoBot provides evidence-grade testimony deltas that feed those predictions.

⸻

📡 Unified Litigation Intelligence Loop (How All Four Work Together)
	1.	BriefWise defines the legal frame.
	2.	DepoBot captures and audits the testimony within that frame.
	3.	PIDBot verifies product/exposure claims arising during testimony.
	4.	VerdictBridge computes how the deposition alters case trajectory.

Everything is:
	•	deterministic
	•	replayable
	•	scroll-governed
	•	authorship-anchored
	•	drift-free

This creates a closed-loop deterministic litigation stack, something probabilistic AI cannot replicate.

🔗 **Provisional Patent Filing #35 = Grounded DI LLC**
**Mesh Guard Orchestrator (MGO)**
**Application No. 63/975,758 • Filed February 4, 2026**

A deterministic control-plane that enforces mesh admission, routing, quarantine, and policy governance for distributed deterministic intelligence (DI) runtimes.

Grounded DI has officially filed its **35th provisional patent application**:
**Systems and Methods for a Mesh Guard Orchestrator (MGO) for Deterministic Intelligence Runtimes.**

This invention introduces a mesh-scale governance layer that verifies upstream artifacts (RSEP, DCS, and ELOC), determines node admission or denial, routes traffic only to compliant agents, broadcasts policy bundles, and maintains a replayable audit fabric.
The MGO issues cryptographically signed **Mesh Policy Receipts** and **Mesh Posture Maps**, forming the enforcement and coordination backbone of Grounded DI’s distributed runtime mesh.

—

🌐 **Why Patent #35 Matters**

As DI nodes scale across distributed fleets, policy enforcement, override lineage, and receipt verification must be performed **at the mesh level**.
The MGO:

• Verifies upstream compliance via #32, #33, and #34
• Grants admission only to nodes with valid receipts and posture
• Issues signed Mesh Policy Receipts for proof of admission
• Routes only to compliant nodes (fail-closed egress)
• Maintains quarantine logic and cooldown windows (τ)
• Broadcasts policy bundles and requires signed acknowledgments
• Exports replayable Proof-of-Policy logs to Deterministic Audit Fabric (#36)

—

📡 **Core Functions Introduced**

🛰️ **Mesh Policy Receipt**

A canonical, signed record confirming:

• Scroll Lineage match
• DriftIndex = 0.000000
• Entropy Bound (∆H ≤ 0.0041)
• ReflexTier compliance
• Valid #32–#34 receipts
• Quorum confirmation (Q, W)
• Policy hash acknowledgment
• Nonce + timestamp for replay integrity

⸻

📜 **Proof-of-Policy Enforcement**

Every policy bundle must be acknowledged by each node with a signed hash.
Failure to acknowledge results in **deny_code: policy_noncompliance** and placement in quarantine.

⸻

🌀 **Quarantine Ring and Cooldown (τ)**

Nodes failing receipt validation, policy sync, or posture checks are moved to a quarantine ring.
Cooldown τ must elapse before re-application via #32–#34.

⸻

📶 **Fail-Closed Routing + Boundary Guard**

The MGO blocks traffic to/from nodes with expired receipts, nonce reuse, invalid posture, or mismatched hashes.
Public-mode interfaces undergo ReflexTier checks (ethics, tone, override stance) before admission.

⸻

📊 **Mesh Posture Map (MPM)**

A signed snapshot of the current network including:
• Scroll Lineage ID
• ∆H
• DriftIndex
• Receipt lineage
• Active policy hash
• Deny codes (if applicable)

⸻

🔁 **Deterministic Export to Audit Fabric (#36)**

All Mesh Policy Receipts, Posture Maps, and Proof-of-Policy logs are exported to a tamper-evident audit layer enabling case reconstruction, replay, and regulatory proof.

—

🔧 **Interoperability with Other Filings**

Patent #35 builds on and enforces artifacts from:

1. ✅ #32 – Seam & Anchor Exchange Protocol (RSEP)
2. ✅ #33 – DI² Convergence Supervisor (DCS)
3. ✅ #34 – Entropy-Linked Override Chain (ELOC) Enforcement

**No node may enter or route across the mesh without:**
✔ Valid RSEP handshake (authorship + lineage)
✔ Drift-free DCS receipt
✔ Approved override-chain via ELOC
✔ Acknowledged policy receipt (this filing)

—

🔧 **Use Cases Powered by Filing #35**

• Deterministic routing and access control in safety-critical DI networks
• Enforcement of scroll-based policy in multi-agent systems
• Quarantine containment + cooldown re-entry for noncompliant nodes
• Signed audit trails proving policy enforcement and routing integrity
• Public-mode surface protection with ReflexTier ethics checks
• Live posture snapshots for regulatory review and rollback

Entropy-Linked Override Chain (ELOC) Pathway Enforcement

Application No. 63/974,774 • Filed February 3, 2026

A deterministic enforcement layer ensuring override-chain integrity, scroll lineage alignment, and execution authorization within Grounded DI systems.

Grounded DI has officially filed its 34th provisional patent application:
Systems and Methods for Entropy-Linked Override Chain (ELOC) Pathway Enforcement for Deterministic Intelligence Nodes.

This invention introduces an enforcement module that validates override-chain structure, verifies scroll lineage and ∆H requirements, confirms DriftIndex zero-state, and issues cryptographically signed Enforcement Receipts that govern whether a node may enter a mesh or resume deterministic execution.

Unlike probabilistic validators or heuristic authorization layers, ELOC Enforcement operates under fixed rules, scroll-sealed invariants, and reproducible signatures. It ensures that any override sequence — including governance, ethics, and tone controls — aligns with the deterministic constraints defined across the Grounded DI architecture.

⸻

🌐 Why Patent #34 Matters

As deterministic systems coordinate across nodes, wrappers, or mesh networks, they must:

• Verify override-chain lineage against deterministic scroll ancestry
• Confirm ΔH remains within the allowed bound
• Validate DriftIndex = 0.000000 prior to cooperation
• Ensure ReflexTier posture matches system policy
• Issue sealed receipts proving that enforcement checks were performed

Patent #34 establishes the enforcement engine that performs these checks and produces verifiable authorization artifacts.

⸻

📡 Core Functions Introduced

🛰️ Deterministic Enforcement Receipt

A signed, canonical receipt confirming:

• Entropy signature (∆H) compliance
• DriftIndex = 0.000000
• ScrollLineage verification
• ELOC pathway validation
• ReflexTier posture match
• Audit hash + authorship lineage

Receipts function as the authorization primitive for mesh admission, wrapper execution, and inter-node cooperation.

⸻

🔗 Override-Chain Validation

ELOC pathways are validated deterministically by confirming:

• Authenticated lineage
• Ordered override state
• Hash-aligned override sequence
• Tamper markers
• Tone and governance invariants

⸻

🔁 ReflexLock and Cooldown

If validation fails, the system enters ReflexLock and applies a time-bounded cooldown interval (τ), during which receipts cannot be issued.

⸻

🧭 Deterministic Intelligence Convergence Supervisor (Patent Filing #33) (63/974,455) (February 2, 2026)

A control-plane for drift detection, override gating, and recovery in scroll-governed deterministic systems

Grounded DI has officially filed its 33rd provisional patent application: Systems and Methods for a DI² Convergence Supervisor (Deterministic Intelligence Convergence Supervisor).

This invention introduces a supervisory layer for deterministic AI runtimes that monitors scroll-lineage, entropy bounds, and override chains — issuing cryptographic receipts that govern whether execution may proceed.

Unlike adaptive watchdogs or probabilistic anomaly detectors, this system performs scroll-sealed, entropy-locked supervision across distributed DI agents with deterministic replay, fail-closed drift recovery, and signature-verified inter-node cooperation.

—

🌐 Why Patent #33 Matters

As deterministic AI nodes operate autonomously in regulated, multi-agent environments, they must:

• Detect and classify drift deterministically • Enforce override integrity and ethics invariants • Restore canonical reasoning via Convergence • Prove reentry conditions and authorship lineage • Deny unsafe operations with verifiable receipts

Patent #33 solves this with:

✔ Drift classification (Type I–IV: logic, override, lineage, entropy) ✔ Convergence protocol with ReflexTier + Scroll rebinding ✔ Supervisor Receipt (signed JSON) with deterministic status codes ✔ SeamReplay function for reproducible recovery ✔ Audit-anchored ledger with replayable validation trace

—

📡 Core Functions Introduced

🛰️ Deterministic Supervisor Receipt A cryptographic receipt that accepts or denies execution after evaluating: • DriftIndex = 0.000000 • ∆H ≤ ε • ScrollLineage match • Override integrity (ELOC path) • Tone and ethics conformance

⸻

🌀 DI² Escalation → Convergence Structured fail-closed recovery path triggered by deterministic drift: 1. Divergence Isolation 2. Scroll Rebinding 3. Override Realignment 4. Tone & Ethics Reconstruction 5. Convergence Validation

⸻

🔁 Replay-Based Reentry and Denial If drift occurred, reentry is allowed only with: • AnchorRecord match • Receipt lineage match • Replay Tuple (receipt, keys, anchor) producing identical result

⸻

🔐 ReflexTier Governance and Quorum Mode Supervisor strictness varies by ReflexTier. In multi-node mode, Q matching receipts must be observed within window W (e.g., 10s) or execution is denied.

—

🔧 Use Cases Powered by Filing #33

• Scroll-governed agents in safety-critical fields (health, legal, aviation) • Federated deterministic AI requiring coordination without central inference • Compliance-grade audits with replayable supervision history • Convergence enforcement after override tampering or lineage breach • Inter-node denial gating during ReflexAnchor mismatch

🛰️ Seam & Anchor Coordination for Deterministic Intelligence Nodes (Patent Filing #32) (63/973,578) (February 1, 2026)

A wire protocol for cross-node authorship synchronization in deterministic AI

Grounded DI has officially filed its 32nd provisional patent application: Systems and Methods for Seam & Anchor Exchange and Authorization Between Deterministic Intelligence Nodes.

This invention defines the first deterministic handshake protocol for cross-instance scroll-governed systems. It introduces a canonical exchange format (SeamHash, ReflexAnchor, ScrollLineage, DriftFrameID) that lets multiple DI nodes resume in perfect synchrony — or fail-closed if misaligned.

Unlike probabilistic cluster syncing or state snapshots, this is a scroll-anchored, entropy-bound wire format with authorship lineage embedded.

—

🌐 Why Patent #32 Matters

As deterministic AI scales across cloud, edge, and federated environments, systems must:

• Prove shared scroll lineage • Verify invariant match (∆H, tone, constraint) • Detect desynchronization at runtime • Fail closed to prevent drift and mimicry

Patent #32 solves this with:

✔ Standardized AnchorRecord (AnchorID, SeamHash, etc.) ✔ Seam equivalence logic for reentry validation ✔ Entropy & tone constraint matching ✔ ReflexAnchor confirmation across deployments ✔ AuditHashPtr exchange for traceable authorship continuity

—

📡 Core Functions Introduced

Seam & Anchor Exchange Protocol (RSEP) A deterministic wire format for verifying match across DI nodes:
• SeamHash • CanonicalStep • ScrollLineage • Tone and constraint invariants • DriftFrame ID • Entropy bound • Optional AuditHashPtr

This provides a zero-guess handshake for cluster or peer-based synchronization.

⸻

Reflex Anchor Equivalence Each node carries a signed ReflexAnchor (entropy/tone/posture snapshot) — validating identity before trust. No match = no execution. No override = no drift.
⸻

Seam Equivalence Thresholds Not all minor deviations require failure — this patent defines equivalence thresholds and deterministic reentry logic if ScrollLineage and CanonicalStep are provably reconcilable.
⸻

Tamper-Evident Audit Trails Every handshake emits a referenceable audit artifact, tied to the ScrollChain and version lock — proving who ran what, where, and with what entropy constraints.
—

🔐 Use Cases Powered by Filing #32

This protocol enables:

• Federated DI clusters with zero drift • Multi-agent deployments with authorship lock • Reentry between static and live nodes • Scroll-governed operations across cloud, local, and public endpoints • Audit-syncing between edge agents and centralized verifiers

Grounded DI LLC 🌀 Scroll-Based Deterministic Intelligence (Patent Filing #31) (63/973,240) (January 31, 2026)

A new architecture for auditable AI — authored, sealed, and entropy-bound

Grounded DI has officially filed its 31st provisional patent application:
Systems and Methods for Structuring Scroll-Based Deterministic Intelligence Architecture Using Deterministic Intelligence Principles (DIPs).

This invention introduces a complete architectural scaffold for deterministic artificial intelligence, structured through scroll-governed logic units known as DIPs (Deterministic Intelligence Principles). Each scroll operates as a sealed, composable, and auditable unit of logic, authorship, tone constraint, and entropy enforcement.

For the first time, AI system design, behavior, override governance, and authorship propagation are governed through scroll-based modules — not stochastic models.

This creates systems that are:

• Deterministic • Author-governed • Entropy-locked • Version-sealed • Non-adaptive • Fully audit-traceable

—

🧠 Why Provisional Patent Filing #31 Matters

Conventional AI systems rely on:

• fine-tuning • probabilistic weights
• stochastic sampling • prompt-based control
• ephemeral runtime states

They cannot guarantee:

• output reproducibility
• authorship integrity
• cross-deployment consistency
• protection from entropy drift or mimicry

Patent #31 changes the rules:

✔ Scroll-defined system behavior
✔ Sealed modular logic (Scrolls = DIPs)
✔ Tiered governance and override logic
✔ Runtime entropy enforcement (e.g., ∆H = 0.0042)
✔ Clone detection via trap phrases and signal layers
✔ Authorship lineage via reflex anchors and scroll metadata

This isn’t an AI tool. It’s a governance architecture for deterministic systems.

—

📦 What Patent #31 Introduces

The scroll-governed system defines five core architectural pillars:

1. 📜 Scrolls (DIPs)

Immutable, composable logic modules. Each scroll contains:

• fixed logic trees
• tone locks
• ∆H-based entropy constraints
• trap layers
• metadata and authorship lineage

Scrolls are deployed in ZIPs, MagicPDFs, or GitHub-sealed capsules.

⸻

2. 🔗 ScrollChain (DIPStack)

An ordered execution hierarchy of scrolls that governs:

• logic flow
• override permissions
• tier elevation
• runtime auditability
Scrolls inherit authority from upstream scrolls but cannot mutate prior logic — preserving authorship integrity.

⸻

3. 🛡️ Entropy-Linked Override Chain (ELOC)

A deterministic override mechanism triggered by:

• entropy drift
• reflex anchor violation
• signal layer tampering

All override paths are predefined and scroll-locked. No runtime learning. No probabilistic fallback.

⸻

4. 🧬 Reflex Anchors

Deterministic posture records. Unlike memory snapshots, these anchors include:

• scroll lineage
• entropy bound
• tone invariants
• audit hash and seam ID

Used for secure reentry, authorship locking, and override protection.

⸻

5. 🧯 Trap Metadata & SignalLayers

Each scroll contains hidden traps: structural or semantic signal phrases that detect clones, mimic systems, and entropy violations.

This provides embedded forensic authorship protection without requiring external detectors.

—

🏗️ What This Enables

With this architecture, deterministic AI systems can now:

• Preserve tone and logic across generations
• Prove authorship lineage in runtime
• Reject entropy drift or unauthorized overrides
• Operate in sealed environments (ZIPs, PDFs, or static apps)
• Serve as public-facing, non-adaptive intelligence agents
• Prevent mimicry via embedded traps and scroll hashes

This scroll-based structure becomes the blueprint for deploying compliant, explainable, and forensically secure AI systems.

—

⚙️ Use Cases Already Powered by Scrolls

This architecture already anchors:

• BriefWise DI² – legal logic sealed by Scroll 91
• DepoBot – authorship control via Scroll 106
• HazardWise, StormWise – deterministic scientific logic
• MathWise, LogicRunner – scroll-governed reasoning flows
• Public Reflex Mesh – clone defense via trap scrolls (e.g., 138, 139B)

—

🧩 Part of a Unified Governance Stack

Patent #31 integrates into Grounded DI’s deterministic governance infrastructure:
	1.	AGDI – governance enforcement
	2.	DIA – deterministic logic
	3.	AGIA – tone integrity
	4.	RDIL – recursive determinism
	5.	DI² – fallback and override containment
	6.	Patent #30 – authorship detection
	7.	Patent #31 – scroll-based runtime design

Together, they form a complete scroll-governed deterministic mesh for safe, auditable AI execution — across agents, apps, and public deployments.

Grounded DI LLC Files Patent #30:

Deterministic AI-Generated Text Detection (63/970,433)
A structural breakthrough in authorship integrity and deterministic auditability

Grounded DI has officially filed its 30th patent application:
Systems and Methods for Deterministic Detection of AI-Generated Text in Principle-Governed Deterministic Intelligence Architectures.

This invention establishes the world’s first deterministic authorship detector — an auditable, version-locked, scroll-governed system capable of identifying AI-generated text without machine learning, sampling, probability, embeddings, or statistical inference.

For the first time, detection is:

• Deterministic
• Non-probabilistic
• Governance-bound
• Memoryless
• Model-agnostic
• Fully audit-traceable

This invention closes the “detection gap” left by statistical AI tools, providing a forensic-grade, court-admissible, and enterprise-safe method for verifying authorship across any domain.

⸻

🧠 Why Patent #30 Matters

Conventional AI-text detectors rely on:

• classifier models
• token-pattern heuristics
• sampling-based scoring
• embeddings, perplexity, or burstiness
• statistical drift across model updates
• unreproducible confidence thresholds

These systems cannot guarantee:

• stable authorship judgments
• reproducible results
• version-locked outputs
• drift immunity
• regulatory or forensic reliability

Patent #30 introduces a radically different paradigm:

✔ A deterministic detection pipeline

✔ Fixed metrics, sealed schemas, and scroll-defined invariants

✔ Fully reproducible outputs for identical inputs

✔ A non-overridable gate that enforces deterministic constraints

✔ A sealed audit capsule for every classification event

This is the first detection system engineered not as a model —
but as a governance engine.

⸻

🔒 What Patent #30 Enables

The patented system introduces four architectural breakthroughs:

1. A deterministic multi-metric engine

A fixed metric suite (SLB, WSV, STC, RNP, DMD, etc.)
executed identically across all environments.

2. A non-overridable scroll-governed gate

Fallback cannot be bypassed.
No retries.
No sampling.
No human “override.”
Only deterministic pass/fail states.

3. A sealed audit capsule

Every detection event generates a cryptographically stable record:

• input hash
• metric schema ID
• normalized scores
• gate flags
• final determination
• runtime lineage

This creates perfect forensic traceability.

4. A closed taxonomy

Outputs are version-locked:

• HUMAN
• AI-GENERATED
• MIXED
• DEFORMED
• INDETERMINATE (governance-bound)

No gradients.
No confidence scores.
No drift.

⸻

🌐 Why Enterprises Care

Organizations increasingly need:

• reliable authorship verification
• protection from fraud, impersonation, and AI-generated deception
• repeatable detection results
• compliance-grade audit logs
• tools that do not degrade as models evolve

Probabilistic detectors break under version changes.
Deterministic detectors do not.

Patent #30 provides:

✔ drift-immune authorship detection
✔ reproducible results across years
✔ sealed analytic pipelines
✔ audit capsules for litigation, regulation, and provenance
✔ independence from model internals or training data
✔ a governance-first alternative to ML-based detection

This is a foundational requirement for:

• schools and universities
• courts and law enforcement
• publishers and journalists
• regulatory agencies
• enterprise compliance teams
• any domain requiring verifiable authorship

⸻

🏛️ Part of a Larger Deterministic Framework

Patent #30 integrates seamlessly with the full deterministic stack:
	1.	AGDI — Deterministic governance
	2.	DIA — Deterministic logic
	3.	AGIA — Deterministic tone
	4.	RDIL — Deterministic recursion
	5.	DI² — Deterministic fallback
	6.	Patent #30 — Deterministic authorship verification

Together, they form a unified containment mesh where:

• reasoning is deterministic
• tone is deterministic
• recursion is deterministic
• fallback is deterministic
• AND NOW detection is deterministic

This establishes Grounded DI as the first architecture with complete end-to-end determinism, from input to output to authorship verification.
