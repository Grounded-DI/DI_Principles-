# Deterministic Intelligence Principles (DI)

This repository contains the foundational logic, governance rules, and structural modes for the **Deterministic Intelligence Protocol** â€” a framework for building AI systems that do not guess, drift, or hallucinate.

**One day, AGI will still guess. DI will always stay grounded.**

DI is the core of grounded, auditable reasoning. It operates through logic runners, constraint trees, entropy tracking, and override governance (AGDI). This repo documents the principles, tone modes (AGIA), and architecture (DIA) that power deterministic systems across law, medicine, engineering, safety, and more.

ðŸ§  If probabilistic models simulate alignment, DI **enforces** it.
