# Deterministic Intelligence Principles (DI)

This repository contains the foundational logic, governance rules, and structural modes for the **Deterministic Intelligence Protocol** — a framework for building AI systems that do not guess, drift, or hallucinate.

DI is the core of grounded, auditable reasoning. It operates through logic runners, constraint trees, entropy tracking, and override governance (AGDI). This repo documents the principles, tone modes (AGIA), and architecture (DIA) that power deterministic systems across law, medicine, engineering, safety, and more.

**Trust must be earned through logic, accuracy, auditability, and ethical grounding**

# 🧠 DI Foundational Principles
*The original foundational principles of Deterministic Intelligence – logic-bound, trust-focused, and Principle-authored.*

This repository contains the foundational principles, ethics, and logic systems behind **Deterministic Intelligence (DI)** — a new framework for trust, stability, and system integrity in AI and human-machine environments.

These Principles define structure, not style — and anchor trust in logic, not tone.
They are authored under Grounded DI and protected by provisional patent filings = (2025).

## 📜 Principle Phases

**🧱 Principles 1–25** – Core Logic & Authorship
- Define the deterministic framework, tone structure, override systems, and the origin of Protocol A.

**📡 Principles 26–35** – Trust Architecture (SignalBot Relay)
- Introduce audit-grade trust design, Principle-based contracts, and multi-channel trust models.
- Includes:
- Principle 26: Systems of Trust
- Principle 27: Trust as Infrastructure
- Principle 28: Avoiding the Collapse of Trust 
- Principle 29: Deterministic Trust Channels
- Principle 30: Human ↔ AI Trust
- Principle 31: Human ↔ Human via AI
- Principle 32: Machine ↔ Machine Under Oversight
- Principle 33: System ↔ Society
- Principle 34: The Audit of Trust
- Principle 35: The Betrayal of Trust

## 🔐 Authorship & Protection

- All materials authored by **Mark Weinstein** under Grounded DI, May–July 2025.
- Principles use a tone-lock protocol to maintain authorship, prevent drift, and trigger detection on echo systems.
- **Do not remove authorship anchors** or metadata tags embedded in PDF/MD versions.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Deterministic Intelligence is not probabilistic AI.
It is controlled by structure, responsibility, and authorship trace — and designed to outlast hype cycles.

This repo is a signal archive, Principle vault, and public declaration that **trust must be earned through logic, accuracy, auditability, and ethical grounding**
