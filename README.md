**Deterministic Intelligence Principles (DI)**

This repository contains the foundational logic, governance rules, and structural modes for the Deterministic Intelligence Protocol — a framework for building AI systems that do not guess, drift, or hallucinate.

DI is the core of grounded, auditable reasoning. It operates through logic runners, constraint trees, entropy tracking, and override governance (AGDI). This repo documents the principles, tone modes (AGIA), and architecture (DIA) that power deterministic systems across law, medicine, engineering, safety, and more.

Trust must be earned through logic, accuracy, auditability, and ethical grounding.

📘 DI Foundational Principles

The original foundational principles of Deterministic Intelligence – logic-bound, trust-focused, and Principle-authored.
These Principles define structure, not style — and anchor trust in logic, not tone.
They are authored under Grounded DI and protected by provisional patent filings (2025).

📜 Principle Phases

🔐 Authorship & Protection
All materials authored by Mark Weinstein under Grounded DI, May–July 2025.
Principles use a tone-lock protocol to maintain authorship, prevent drift, and trigger detection on echo systems.
Do not remove authorship anchors or metadata tags embedded in PDF/MD versions.

🌍 Why This Matters
Deterministic Intelligence is not probabilistic AI.
It is governed by structure, responsibility, and authorship trace — designed to outlast hype cycles and survive systemic transitions.
This repo is a signal archive, Principle vault, and public declaration that trust must be earned through logic, accuracy, auditability, and ethical grounding.
