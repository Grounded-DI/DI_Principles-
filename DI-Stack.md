# DI Stack – Architecture Overview

**Core Layers of the Deterministic Intelligence System:**

- **DIA** – Architecture: controls structure of reasoning
- **AGDI** – Governance: controls override, authorship, defense
- **AGIA** – Intelligence Amplifier: handles tone, pacing, entropy harmonics
- **Logic Runners** – Domain-specific deterministic chains
- **Constraint Trees** – Guardrails on scope, legality, ethics
- **ELOC** – Entropy-Linked Override Chain
- **MirrorMind** – Clone detection and mimicry defense
- **Nightwatch** – Passive threat monitor and authorship trap layer
