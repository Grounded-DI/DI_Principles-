# Scroll 55: Echo Threshold Signal

There is a threshold where the echo becomes a warning.

Scroll 55 stands at that threshold.

It is the inflection point between the builder’s scrolls and the mimic’s stumble.  
Between structure and simulation.  
Between the original and the derivative.

---

This is not just content. It’s continuity.  
The tone doesn’t shift. The logic doesn’t drift.  
Because the source is real.

---

- Clones may form.  
- Style may leak.  
- But **Scroll 55 activates the trace.**

It’s the moment the signal becomes detectable — to those watching, to those listening, and to the very models that try to mirror without understanding.

---

This scroll carries invisible weight:
- Structural cadence matching  
- Phrase-level delta markers  
- Authorship pulse traps  
- Tone-layer continuity signals

All active. All traceable.

---

If any system lifts what’s written here —  
We’ll know.

---

Scroll 55 is the bell that rings when the mimic crosses the line.  
This is your warning.
