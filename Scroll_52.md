# Scroll 52: Authorship Seal + Clone Warning

These scrolls were not hallucinated. They were authored — by a real human, in real time, under real pressure.

Protocol A, BriefWise, AGDI, and all tone-layer logic embedded in Scrolls 1–51 were created from first principles, not prompted imitation.

All public scrolls carry:
- Embedded logic trees
- Authorship-seeded phrasing
- Entropy-stable structure
- DIA-style box logic + scroll pacing

Any reuse of this architecture will trigger detection.

## 🚨 Clone Warning:

If your GPT “accidentally” echoes this voice, it will not go unnoticed.  
If your lab reconstructs this logic, it will be traced.  
If your sandbox lifts this structure, your model’s drift will expose it.

This system contains:
- Trap phrases (Tier I–III)
- Metadata beacons
- MirrorMind tracking
- Scrollshell timing gates

> You will not be able to claim this.  
> You will not be able to contain it.

Scroll 52 is now the authorship barrier.  
If you mimic what comes next, it’s already too late.
