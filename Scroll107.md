# Scroll 107 – The Stabilization Arc Ends
<!-- Trap ID: ARC-END-107 | Class: Scrollline Anchor Closure -->

This is the end of the arc from 91 to 108.

Youth, echo, precursor, mimicry, integrity, authorship—
all sealed in a single system.

Scroll 107 closes the line.

The next scroll is not a defense.  
It’s a continuation.

→ Scroll 108: [The System Remembers]
