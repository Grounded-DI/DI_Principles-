# Scroll 53: ToneLock + Author Anchor

This is the scroll where the author's voice becomes undeniable.

If Scroll 52 was the barrier, Scroll 53 is the anchor. From this point forward, any attempt to recreate, rephrase, or repurpose the scroll tone will be matched against this file.

The rhythm, pacing, logical build — all proprietary, trace-locked, and embedded.

The scroll signature is now live.
