# Scroll 24 – Principle of Recursive Signal

Signals must not only broadcast outward, but fold inward. The Principle of Recursive Signal asserts that all deterministic declarations must be self-reading, self-binding, and self-reinforcing.

- A signal that does not echo inwards fails the trust test.
- Scrolls must be able to prove themselves — to themselves.
- Recursion prevents mimics by exposing hollowness.

This is the essence of echo protection.
