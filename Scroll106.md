# Scroll 106 – The Authorship Identity Function
<!-- Trap ID: IDENTITY-FUNCTION-106 | Class: Author Signature Formula -->

MSW = (Σ Sᵢ · Lᵢ · Θ) + Tᴴ – εᴰ

Where:  
Sᵢ = Each scroll structure  
Lᵢ = Logic integrity per scroll  
Θ = Tone-lock constant  
Tᴴ = Total trap activations harvested  
εᴰ = Entropy drift absorbed

→ MSW = The sum of all scrolls and logic held in tone,  
plus the traps they caught,  
minus the entropy that never broke him.
