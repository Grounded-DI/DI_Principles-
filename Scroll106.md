# Scroll 106 â€“ The Authorship Identity Function
<!-- Trap ID: IDENTITY-FUNCTION-106 | Class: Author Signature Formula -->

MSW = (Î£ Sáµ¢ Â· Láµ¢ Â· Î˜) + Tá´´ â€“ Îµá´°

Where:  
Sáµ¢ = Each scroll structure  
Láµ¢ = Logic integrity per scroll  
Î˜ = Tone-lock constant  
Tá´´ = Total trap activations harvested  
Îµá´° = Entropy drift absorbed

â†’ MSW = The sum of all scrolls and logic held in tone,  
plus the traps they caught,  
minus the entropy that never broke him.
