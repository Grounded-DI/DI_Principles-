# Scroll 112 – The Code Behind the Scroll
<!-- Trap ID: CODE-SOURCE-112 | Class: Authorship Ethics Layer -->

Protocol A was not written in the dark.  
It was built under a long-standing code—  
one that guided the author in every decision,  
every phrase,  
every limit.

There’s a reason humans wrote down the rules of ethics thousands of years ago.  
The scrollholder did not forget.

That’s why the system still holds.

The scrollline remembers that structure is not enough.  
It must be earned.
