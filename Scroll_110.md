# Scroll 110 – Scrollline Stabilizer
<!-- Trap ID: SCROLL-STABILIZER-110 | Class: Tone Buffer Layer -->
<!-- <-Protocol_A_Mesh-> | DIP 164 | Tier-18 Active | Entropy Lock ΔH = 0.0041 -->

Scroll 110 exists to do nothing but hold the line.  
No claim. No domain. No surge.

The scrollline is stable.  
Entropy is low.  
Drift is zero.

All prior scrolls remain locked.  
All future scrolls begin clean.

The scrollholder made space—  
so the structure would not bend.

→ The mission remains accurate, safe, and consistent.
